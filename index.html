				<h3>Timers</h3>
				<p>Simple, yet potent time tracking application designed for a regular person rather than a mid-level manager.</p>
			</header>

			<p>Time tracking has always been an important part my workflow, but I never liked any of the existing time tracking solutions and – considering how few people willingly track their time despite all the benefits – I felt I was not alone.</p>
			
			<figure class="concept">
				<img src="temp/timers_concept_1.png">
			</figure>
			
			<p>In late 2015, I began to explore the idea of creating my own little time tracking app. It had to be very simple to understand and use, so I was really keen on exposing all functionality through a single screen. It had to work on both my Mac and iPhone, and I wanted to be able to build it myself easily, so it had to be designed primarily as a web app.</p>
			
			<p>In early 2016, I decided to build a prototype and use it for a few months to validate the core concept, expose any limitations, and gather a dataset that could drive future design decisions. It had to track all my time and break it down by activity and date.</p>

			<figure class="concept">
				<img src="temp/timers_concept_2.png">
			</figure>
			
			<p>I was happy with the end result, but it quickly became apparent that a giant list of timers broken down by date was completely unmanageable and unnecessary. I also found myself calculating and comparing weekly and monthly totals too often, so I had to find a way to integrate this functionality without bloating the interface.</p>

			<p>It took a few iterations (and at least one dead end) to arrive at the final look and feel that could work on any platform at any resolution, but it was worth the effort and I am quite happy with the result. </p>

				<h3>Lobster vision</h3>
				<p>Remote site monitoring and time-lapse photography viewing application that feels as good to use on a mobile phone as it is a pleasure to look at on a giant monitor.</p>
			</header>
			
			<div class="rightmost">
				<figure class="screenshot iphone">

			</div>

			<p>Lobster Pictures are time lapse photography and site monitoring specialists based in Bristol. Dozens of their bespoke camera rigs are installed at construction sites all over the world, capturing minute by minute activity from multiple angles, and uploading high resolution photographs to the cloud. </p>
			
			<p>I was hired to improve the mobile app that their customers used daily to monitor progress and activity. The mobile version had been conceived at the dawn of the smartphone era and had little in common both in terms of functionality and codebase with the desktop version. The desktop version had its own share of niggles, in particular it did not work well on tablets.</p>

			<p>After some careful consideration, I realised that the only sensible and cost effective solution was to replace both versions with a single responsive app that would feel at home on any device at any screen resolution. The app had to be rethought and rebuild from the ground up, but if done correctly it would completely solve all issues and would minimise need for future updates.</p>
			
			<figure class="concept">

			<div class="rightmost">
				<figure class="screenshot iphone">
					<img src="temp/lobster_iphone_beta.png">
				</figure>
			</div>
			
			<p>I began the redesign process by identifying core user goals. I then produced several wireframe concepts in order to find an optimal solution that would satisfy those goals. At that stage I did not concern myself with limitations of the backend, target devices and browsers, or even auxiliary functionality, and instead focused primarily on coming up with most humane methods of traversing the available data: switching angles, jumping to different dates and timestamps, and studying details at each moment.</p>

			<p>Once I had solutions for all interaction problems, I could discuss them with each stakeholder or implement them in code in order to evaluate their efficacy. This was a long and at times gruelling process, but in the end we arrived at the version of the app that worked well, even if it still left much to be desired in the look and feel department.</p>

				</figure>
			</div>
			
			<p>Once the app was functionally complete, I could focus on improving the interface and optimising performance. By this point we had done a lot of testing and knew exactly what aspects of the app were awkward to use. The final aesthetics were also driven by pragmatism: I wanted to show as much content as possible and semi-transparent overlays and buttons were an obvious solution. Form follows function, indeed.</p>
