		<p>I find great pleasure in the process of identifying a problem, taking into consideration a wide range of technical, business and marketing constraints, and coming up with a solution that is both efficient and humane in its execution.</p>

		<p>I designed and built several <a href="#recent-projects">web apps</a>, a veriety of <a href="#employment-history">traditional websites</a>, as well as a couple of <a href="#open-source-libraries">open-source libraries</a>.</p>

		<p>I am proficient in both front-end and back-end technologies as well interaction design:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Vanilla HTML, CSS, JavaScript; frameworks and libraries such as LESS, SASS, jQuery, Backbone.js, React, Vue.js.</li>
			<li>Vanilla PHP and MySQL; frameworks and CMS such as CodeIgniter, CakePHP, Laravel, Wordpress, Perch.</li>
			<li>Technical writing, API and database design, wireframe prototyping, responsive design, user testing.</li>
		</ul>

			<h3>Timers</h3>

			<p>Time tracking has always been an important part my work process, but I never liked any of the existing time tracking solutions and – considering how few people willingly track their time despite all the benefits – I felt I was not alone.</p>

			<p>In late 2015, I began to explore the idea of creating my own little time tracking app. It had to be very simple to understand and use, so I was really keen on exposing all functionality through a single screen. It had to work on both my Mac and iPhone, and I wanted to be able to build it myself easily, so it had to be designed primarily as a web app.</p>

			<p>In early 2016, I decided to build a prototype and use it for a few months to validate the core concept, expose any limitations, and gather a dataset that could drive future design decisions. It had to track all my time and break it down by activity and date.</p>

			<p>I was happy with the end result, but it quickly became apparent that a giant list of timers broken down by date was completely unmanageable and unnecessary. I also found myself calculating and comparing weekly and monthly totals too often, so I had to find a way to integrate this functionality without bloating the interface.</p>

			<p>It took a few iterations (and at least one dead end) to arrive at the final look and feel that could work on any platform at any resolution, but it was worth the effort and I am quite happy with the result. </p>

			<h3>Lobster vision</h3>

			<p>Lobster Pictures are time lapse photography and site monitoring specialists based in Bristol. Dozens of their bespoke camera rigs are installed at construction sites all over the world, capturing minute by minute activity from multiple angles, and uploading high resolution photographs to the cloud. </p>

			<p>I was hired to improve the mobile app that their customers used daily to monitor progress and activity. The mobile version had been conceived at the dawn of the smartphone era and had little in common both in terms of functionality and codebase with the desktop version. The desktop version had its own share of niggles, in particular it did not work well on tablets.</p>

			<p>After some careful consideration, I realised that the only sensible and cost effective solution was to replace both versions with a single responsive app that would feel at home on any device at any screen resolution. The app had to be rethought and rebuild from the ground up, but if done correctly it would completely solve all issues and would minimise need for future updates.</p>

			<p>I began the redesign process by identifying core user goals and then produced several wireframe concepts in order to find an optimal solution that could satisfy them. At that stage I did not concern myself with limitations of the backend, target devices and browsers, or even auxiliary functionality, and instead focused primarily on coming up with most humane methods of traversing the available data: switching angles, jumping to different dates and timestamps, and studying details at each moment.</p>

			<p>Once I had solutions for all interaction problems, I could discuss them with each stakeholder or implement them in code in order to evaluate their efficacy. This was a long and at times gruelling process, but in the end we arrived at the version of the app that worked well, even if it still left much to be desired in the look and feel department.</p>

			<p>Once the app was functionally complete, I could focus on improving the interface and optimising performance. By this point we had done a lot of testing and knew exactly what aspects of the app were awkward to use. The final aesthetics were also driven by pragmatism: I wanted to show as much content as possible and semi-transparent overlays and buttons were an obvious solution. Form follows function, indeed.</p>

		<h2>Employment history</h2>

		<h3>Lead web developer and interaction designer, Colour &amp; Thing, 2013—2015</h3>

		<p>Working at <a href="//colourandthing.com">Colour &amp; Thing</a> not only enabled me to reach a great variety of clients (<a href="//aub.ac.uk">Arts University Bournemouth</a>, <a href="//martinboroson.com">Martin Boroson</a>, <a href="//boxsteambrewery.com/">Box Steam Brewery</a>), but also helped me develop leadership skills, understand marketing and branding aspects of design, and further improve my skills as an interaction designer.</p>

		<h3>Web developer and interaction designer, Hex Collective, 2010—2013</h3>

		<p>Having worked with <a href="//hexcollective.co.uk">Hex Collective</a> on several projects before, I was offered a permanent position as a developer and interaction designer. While there I designed and developed websites and apps for traditional companies (BSM, TrakCel, Linux IT) as well startups (GroupOut, a party sharing website; Comono, an event management app).</p>

		<h3>Web developer, Self-employed, 2005—2010</h3>

		<p>Having had built a few websites as part of various hobbies, I began my career as a remote contractor: I was a front-end developer on projects for forward thinking design brands such as YouHeShe and Normann Copenhagen; I cut my teeth at back-end development working with several startups, the most successful being VoucherCloud, where I was responsible for API design, and implementation of data management and analytics tools.</p>

		<h2>Open-source libraries</h2>

		<h3>æ framework</h3>

		<p>æ (pronounced ’ash’) is a simple PHP framework. It is a perfect expression of most important lessons I learned as a PHP developer. It is also my magnum opus, which I am not likely to ever truly finish, and yet I am still proud of getting it this far. Working on this set of handy tools not only made me a better developer, but also a better designer.</p>

		<h3>order.less</h3>

		<p>Order.less is an easy to use collection of LESS mixins and best practices for creating and managing pixel perfect grid-based layouts. You set the number of columns you want in your grid, the gutter and baseline sizes, your font size scale, and use the same offset and size property names as you do in CSS. The library does all computations and adjusts respective CSS properties with no extra HTML markup required.</p>
